        <p>When You Think Of Fresh Flowers, Like Maybe A Rose Or Jasmine, You’re Essentially Thinking Of Scents In The Floral Family. Given Their Distinct Feminine Characteristic, They Are Easily Loved By Most And Are Some Of The Most Popular Scents. Love Herbal, Spicy Or Vanilla Smells? These Fall Under The Ambers Category. For Occasions When You Wish To Feel Sensual Or Exotic, This Is The Fragrance Family To Choose From. Think Of Sandalwood Or Even Cedar. These Belong To The Woody Family. If Your Style Spells Warm And Opulent, Choose Woody Smells To Take The Style Quotient A Notch Higher.The Fresh Family Comprises Citrusy And Oceanic Fragrances. If You’re Going To Work Or Are Meeting Your Friends For Lunch, These Are The Ones To Choose From.</p>
        <br>

        <u><h1>How To Use/Apply Fragrance</h1></u>
        <p>perfumes</p>
        <p>Women: Be Strategic With How You Spray Your Fragrance. Start With A Small Amount On Your Pulse Points, You Can Apply Some On The Inside Of Your Elbow, The Nape Of Your Neck And On Your Wrists. Then Spray Some Behind Your Ears. This Spot Is Oilier And Retains The Fragrance For Longer. Also, Spray The Perfume Behind Your Knees Where The Warmth Makes The Fragrance Rise Around You All Day. Finally, Mist Your Belly Button, Where The Fragrance Can Nest And Last Longer. Another Way To Apply Fragrance Is To Spray The Perfume On Your Comb Before Brushing Your Hair.</p>
        <p>Men: Apply The Perfume To The Warmest Spots Or Pulse Points On Your Body. Warm Areas, Like Inner Elbows, Wrists, Shoulders, Chest, And Neck, Can Project The Fragrance More Effectively.Avoid The Temptation To Rub Your Wrists After Applying Perfume, As This Breaks Down The Molecules. Also, Ensure Not To Spray Perfume On Your Clothes. Direct Application On The Skin Works Best</p>
        <p>Spray Deodorants: Shake The Bottle Well And Hold It 15 Centimetres Away From Your Body. Spray Under Each Arm For A Few Seconds To Cover The Whole Armpit Area.</p>
        <p>After Shave: Pour 2-3 Drops Of Aftershave In Your Palm. Rub Your Palms Together. Wait For Some Of The Alcohol To Evaporate. Then Evenly Massage It On Your Skin</p>
